### CSS Positioning Challenges

This repository contains solutions to CSS positioning challenges based on specific design requirements. Each case presents a unique design problem and requires using specific CSS positioning techniques to achieve the desired layout.


### Case 1: Absolute and Relative Positions

- Implement a design using only absolute and relative positions, utilizing the entire screen space without changing layout upon browser resize. No images are allowed, and suitable measurement units must be applied.

### Case 2: Absolute, Relative, and Box Model

- Create a design structure using relevant HTML elements styled with absolute, relative, and box model properties. Ensure that the side navigation bar adjusts its height dynamically based on content and maintains structure integrity when new content is added.

### Case 3: Fixed Position

- Design a layout using fixed positioning where two main borders remain centered on the viewport while allowing content to flow within them.

### Case 4: Sticky Position

- Utilize sticky positioning along with absolute and relative positions to implement a specific design.

### Case 5 & 6: Grid Layout

- Implement designs for case 5 and case 6 using CSS Grid Layout, providing structured layouts for various elements while maintaining responsiveness and flexibility.
